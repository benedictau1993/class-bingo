## Let's play Bingo!

This is a bingo sheet generator for the Terminal, rather than IPython. It is written in Python 3.

#### Package requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- random
- colorclass
- terminaltables

#### Future developments:
- add Python `curses sc\rc` functionality to overwrite previous bingo sheets instead of printing a new sheet below
- integration with Google Sheets with Google API
- logic when Bingo
- special effects when Bingo
- interaction with other Bingo players
